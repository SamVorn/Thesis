JSON working
CSV working
XLSX working
XML NOT working -> functions but repeats information

Need to add txt and yaml/yml parsing
- considering switching from rule based to ML PII flagging

12/4
1. Choose between model types - talk about in thesis
- HuggingFace model (easier fine-tuning)
- GPT model via API (if needing to fine-tune use GPT-2) - cannot use gpt-4 too massive and cannot send pii to gpt that is a breach
- look into more models
2. Find candidates for sensitive data 
- Database can  be sql based or not (mongodb vs sql) (variable)
- Ask for approval “hey this is the analysis and what is says based on your selection im going to anonymize it” - pick method from report

1/5
resolved importing issues on new pc 
- import pyyaml and openpyxl

1/12
testing with mongo db, having to set up docker
docker setup complete
need to set up sql based database reading
need to set up file system based database reading
worked on mongo db database reading - not broad to NoSQL databases must study
attempting data abstraction, need to test on another NoSQL database to check if works

1/13
worked on SQL based database reading
edited docker compose yaml file 
SQL based databases should be able to work, need to check with something other than SQL Lite to see
began implementation of file based database interface adapter

next steps - 
1. implement version with gpt 4 to check pii
2. fine tune ML model to take place of gpt 4 to check pii
3. test with other NoSQL and SQL based databases
4. use live databases
5. begin data anonymization pipeline once pii detector is complete
