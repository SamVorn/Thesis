JSON working
CSV working
XLSX working
XML NOT working -> functions but repeats information

Need to add txt and yaml/yml parsing
- considering switching from rule based to ML PII flagging

12/4
1. Choose between model types - talk about in thesis
- HuggingFace model (easier fine-tuning)
- GPT model via API (if needing to fine-tune use GPT-2) - cannot use gpt-4 too massive and cannot send pii to gpt that is a breach
- look into more models
2. Find candidates for sensitive data 
- Database can  be sql based or not (mongodb vs sql) (variable)
- Ask for approval “hey this is the analysis and what is says based on your selection im going to anonymize it” - pick method from report
